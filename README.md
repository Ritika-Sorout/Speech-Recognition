# Speech-Recognition
A robust speech recognition system that converts spoken language into text. Features include real-time transcription, multi-language support, noise handling, and a customizable vocabulary. Built using Python, SpeechRecognition, and NLTK, this project is ideal for transcription services, voice-activated apps, and accessibility tools.
Features

Real-time Speech Recognition: Converts live audio into text with minimal latency.
Multi-language Support: Capable of recognizing and transcribing speech in multiple languages.
Noise Handling: Implements filters to minimize the impact of background noise on transcription accuracy.
Customizable Vocabulary: Allows the user to add custom words or phrases to improve recognition in specific contexts.
Interactive Interface: Includes a user-friendly interface for ease of use and visualization of transcription results.
Technologies Used

Python for the core development
SpeechRecognition library for capturing and processing audio input
pydub for audio file manipulation
NLTK for natural language processing tasks
Flask for developing the web interface (if applicable)
Google Web Speech API (or other APIs) for handling complex speech recognition tasks
